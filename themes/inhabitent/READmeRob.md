Project 3 - InstaNews
=======

## **Please read me**

I set out to complete all the minimum requirements for this project.

For the design specifications, I declared the base structure and typography within my sass files. Colors were stored as variables within SASS.

In terms of HTML, I believe I used semantically appropriate HTML tags where appropriate. For the CSS, I did not attempt to replicate the templates 100%, rather I wanted to translate the vision of the designer pretty well. I used mainly flexbox to obtain the requred format of the website boxes. I used font-family to import all the fonts and implemented a CSS reset. I did use SASS to store variables and for nesting elements.

For Javacsript and Jquery, I implemented a dynamic search menu as per the demo website, using a toggle function. 

In terms of wordpress, I found my initial grasp on the concepts to be pretty slow, however I eventually gained a firm understanding of custom wordpress themes, WP queries and the main wordpress loop. I implemented custom tanoxomies, and was able to figure out how to link all the pages using the wordpress heirachy. I created all the necessary PHP pages, the only 2 PHP pages that were not styled were the 404 and the archive.php pages. 

I was not able to finish the stretch goals as I wanted to be 100% done every other aspect first.

All in all, this project was very challenging, yet a very rewarding lesson on wordpress and time management skills. I was happy to hand this one in, however I do look forward to returning to finish the stretch goals and to fine-tune everything else.
